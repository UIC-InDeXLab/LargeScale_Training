#Sampling-Based Techniques for Training Deep Neural Networks with Limited Computational Resources


Approx_LSH: includes ALSH setting of the neural network. Run main.py to see the results. The configurtions can be changed on main.py.

Regular_NN: Includes standard setting of the neural network. Run main.py.

DropOut: Includes DropOut and Adaptive-Dropout implementation. Run main.py to see the results.

Activation function: Relu, Weight initialization: Kaiming initialization.
Loss Function = Negative Log Liklehood

Datasets: MNIST, NORB, Fashion-MNIST.
Input and output dimension must change corresponding to the dataset.

Dataset : Input.   Output.
NORB    : 9216       5
MNIST   : 784        10 
FMNIST  : 784        10
